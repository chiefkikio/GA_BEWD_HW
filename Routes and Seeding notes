Routes and Seeding
What is REST? 
	* REpresentational State Transfer (making URL's that are descriptive)
	* Key
		- base url like http://localhost:3000/users
		- additional indicator of the information we'd like to send ike http://localhost:3000/users/1
		- media type to return like html, plaintext, JSON
		- standard HTTP verb: GET, PUT, POST, DELETE
			- GET is the type for when you don't have any data
			- PUT, POST, DELETE don't have data in the URL
				- PUT: modifying resource
				- POST: for creating new users or adding information (new entity)
				- DELETE: delete a resouce (ie DELETE/users/1)
	* CRUD actions (Create, read, update and delete) - basic functions of storage

RAILS AND REST
	* rails uses restful routing by default

EXAMPLE URL'S:
	* if you want to get a profile
		get 'profile/:id', to 'users#show'

RESOURCES:photos gives 7 routelines automatically 
	GET /photos
	GET /photos/new
	POST /photos
	GET /photos/:id
	GET /photos/:id/edit
	PATCH/PUT /photos/:id
	DELETE /photos/:id

you could have separate controllers for admins
or you could just have just one controller

SEEDING THE DATABASE
* we don't store the data in version control cuz that would be huge
* If we want to get up and running on the project, they can just clone and then seed
* seeding = populating database with default data
